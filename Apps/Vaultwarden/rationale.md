# Vaultwarden — Rationale

## What deviation / exception is being requested

Three, all documented below:

1. **`SIGNUPS_ALLOWED: "true"`** — until the owner turns signups off, any visitor who finds
   the address can create an account.
2. **`DISABLE_ADMIN_TOKEN: "true"`** — Vaultwarden's own `/admin` gate is turned off and
   the app ships with no `ADMIN_TOKEN` at all. An AppShield SSO sidecar gates `/admin`
   instead.
3. **Non-standard Caddy labels** — each site block splits by path into two `handle`
   branches instead of a single `reverse_proxy`, so that the sidecar sits in front of
   `/admin` **only**.

## 1. Open signup

### Why it is necessary

- **It is the only bootstrap path.** Vaultwarden has no seeded first user and no
  "create the owner account" flow outside of signup. With `SIGNUPS_ALLOWED: "false"` from
  the start, a freshly installed instance has zero accounts and no way to make one from
  the normal UI — the owner would have to go to `/admin` and invite themselves by email,
  which requires working outbound SMTP.
- **SMTP is not guaranteed to work.** The compose points `SMTP_HOST` at the platform
  `smtp` relay, but invitation mail depends on that relay being reachable and on the
  destination accepting it. Making first-run account creation depend on an email round
  trip would turn a zero-config install into a support case whenever mail is unavailable.
- **It is the upstream default.** `vaultwarden/server` ships `SIGNUPS_ALLOWED=true`;
  this app does not loosen anything relative to upstream.

### Security mitigations in place

- **Open signup does not expose any existing vault.** Every vault is encrypted client-side
  under its own master password, which the server never holds. A new account created by a
  stranger is an empty vault; it grants no read access to the owner's data, and the admin
  panel cannot decrypt a user vault either — stated in `tips.before_install`.
- **The owner is told to close it, in the install dialog, before they install.**
  `tips.before_install` step 3 is "Secure your instance: Disable new signups in admin
  panel once set up", alongside a direct link to the admin panel.

### Alternatives considered and rejected

1. **`SIGNUPS_ALLOWED: "false"` out of the box** — rejected: it leaves a new install with
   no accounts and no UI path to create one. Recovery requires the admin panel plus
   working SMTP, which is exactly the fragile dependency described above.
2. **`SIGNUP_DOMAINS_WHITELIST`** — rejected: it restricts *which* email domains may
   register, not *whether* an anonymous visitor may. On a personal server the owner's
   address is often at a large public provider, so whitelisting that domain would leave
   registration effectively open anyway.
3. **Auto-disabling signups after the first account** — rejected: Vaultwarden has no such
   setting, and a hook that rewrote the container's environment after first boot would be
   invisible to the user and would fight `restart: unless-stopped`.

---

## 2. No admin token — SSO in front of `/admin`

### Why it is necessary

**The admin token was a shared secret, not a secret.** The app previously set
`ADMIN_TOKEN: $APP_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` and printed it in `tips.before_install`.
`APP_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` is a PCS-wide value injected into *every* app's environment, so the
password manager's admin panel was gated by a credential that every other container on the
box already holds, in plaintext, in its own `docker inspect` output.

This is the configuration upstream documents for exactly this case. From the
[Disable admin token](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Disable-admin-token)
wiki page:

> If you have another method you would like to use for authentication to the `/admin` page
> then you can set the `DISABLE_ADMIN_TOKEN` variable to true. This will disable the built
> in `ADMIN_TOKEN` used for authentication while also enabling the admin panel. […]
> Anyone with access to the URL will be able to access the admin panel. You will need to
> take extra steps to secure it. This includes externally and locally.

and from `.env.template`:

> `## Enable this to bypass the admin panel security. This option is only`
> `## meant to be used with the use of a separate auth layer in front`

AppShield is that layer, and the Caddy split below is what confines it to `/admin`.

### Alternatives considered and rejected

- **Argon2 PHC hash for `ADMIN_TOKEN`** (upstream's `vaultwarden hash`). Keeps the
  plaintext out of `docker inspect`, but the plaintext *is* `APP_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`, which
  stays readable in every other app's environment. Hides the copy, not the secret.
- **Dropping the admin panel entirely** (leaving `ADMIN_TOKEN` unset disables it). Loses
  signup control, user management and diagnostics.

## 3. Path-split Caddy labels

### Why it is necessary

AppShield protects a whole origin: everything is authenticated except what
`ALLOWED_PATHS` exempts, and it has **no inverse setting** — no way to say "protect only
this path" (verified against `appshield:3.0.2`). Putting it in front of the whole app
therefore costs a second login on the vault itself: the PCS SSO first, then the Vaultwarden
master password. That is a real cost paid by every user on every visit, to protect a page
the owner opens twice a year.

So the split is done one layer up, in Caddy, which does have path matchers:

```
@sso path /admin /admin/* /nhl-auth/*
handle @sso   { reverse_proxy vaultwarden:80 }          # the SSO sidecar
handle        { reverse_proxy vaultwarden-backend:80 }  # everything else, direct
```

`/nhl-auth/*` is AppShield 3.x's own reserved endpoint prefix (login, OIDC callback,
logout) and must reach the sidecar for the login round trip to complete. Everything else —
the web vault and the entire Bitwarden client protocol (`/api`, `/identity`,
`/notifications`, `/events`, `/icons`, `/attachments`, `/app-id.json`, `/.well-known`) —
is proxied straight to Vaultwarden exactly as before this change, so no client, app or
extension sees any difference.

This is the same shape the Vaultwarden community uses with Authelia and Caddy
(`forward_auth` scoped to an `/admin` matcher), and the same label mechanism already
shipped in `Apps/qBittorrent`.

### Security mitigations in place

- **The vault's own auth is untouched.** Master password, 2FA and Vaultwarden's brute-force
  protection still guard every account; the sidecar only adds a second, independent gate in
  front of the admin page.
- The backend carries no Caddy labels of its own — the routing decision exists in exactly
  one place, on the sidecar service.
- Resource limits on both services; AppShield runs with Docker's default capability set.
- **`DOMAIN` is pinned** to `https://vaultwarden-$APP_DOMAIN`, so Vaultwarden issues its
  own links and WebAuthn origins against the gateway hostname rather than an
  attacker-supplied `Host` header.
- `OIDC_REQUIRED_GROUPS: "admins"` is present as a commented-out one-liner on the sidecar
  for deployments that want the panel restricted to the `admins` group.

### Alternatives considered and rejected

- **AppShield in front of the whole app, with `ALLOWED_PATHS` exempting the client
  protocol.** Tested and working (24/24), and it fails *closed* — no mistake in the
  exemption list can expose `/admin`. Rejected because it puts an SSO login in front of the
  web vault, i.e. two logins to read a password. Deliberate trade, made with eyes open:
  see the residual risk below.
- **A separate `vaultwardenadmin-` hostname for the sidecar.** Would need a second
  AppShield container whose name is not the app name, which `auth-registrar` attests by
  PTR lookup; and it still requires blocking `/admin` on the main hostname, so it carries
  the same failure mode as the split with more moving parts.

## Data protection

- All state lives in `${DATA_ROOT:-/DATA}/AppData/vaultwarden/data/` and survives uninstall
  / reinstall and image upgrades. This is a front-door change only: no migration, no change
  to the SQLite database or the RSA key. Existing installs keep the same hostname and URLs,
  and every configured client keeps its connection.
- Vault contents are end-to-end encrypted under each user's master password. The server
  stores ciphertext only; neither the admin panel nor filesystem access to the PCS yields
  plaintext.
- `tips.before_install` opens by warning that a lost master password makes the vault
  permanently unrecoverable, so the user is told before install that recovery is not
  something the server operator can perform.

### Accepted residual risks (deliberate)

1. **The split fails open.** With `DISABLE_ADMIN_TOKEN`, the admin panel's only protection
   is the `@sso` branch. If those labels are dropped or reordered, `/admin` reaches
   Vaultwarden with no credential at all. Note that a *broken* matcher is a Caddy config
   error rather than a silent bypass — the site block fails to load — but a *deleted* one
   is not. Anyone editing this compose must treat the label block as security-critical.
2. **Any PCS SSO account can open the admin panel**, not only the owner — verified: a user
   outside `admins` gets in. `OIDC_REQUIRED_GROUPS: "admins"` closes this (also verified:
   a non-admin is then bounced to the PCS dashboard) and is left commented out on purpose.
3. **A container on the shared `pcs` network can reach `http://vaultwarden-backend/admin`
   with no credential** — this is the "and locally" upstream warns about. The backend stays
   on `pcs` because it has to resolve the `smtp` mail gateway. It is not a regression: the
   shipped `ADMIN_TOKEN` was `APP_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`, which those same containers already
   hold.

## Verification

Tested on wisera (`vaultwarden-wisera.inojob.com`) on 2026-09-07 against
`appshield:3.0.2` + `vaultwarden/server:1.37.0`. **27/27 checks.**

- Gated (302 → `/nhl-auth/oidc/login`): `/admin`, `/admin/`, `/admin/users`,
  `/admin/diagnostics`, `/admin/organizations/overview`, `POST /admin`,
  `POST /admin/users/<id>/deauth`, `POST /admin/config`, `/admin/logout`.
- Not gated, served straight from Vaultwarden: `/` (the web vault SPA loads at `#/login`
  with no SSO prompt), `/index.html`, `/vw_static/*`, `/css/vaultwarden.css`, `/alive`,
  `/app-id.json`, `/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`, `/icons/…`, `/api/config`,
  `/identity/accounts/prelogin`.
- Full client flow, all direct: register → `identity/connect/token` → `/api/sync` →
  create cipher → attachment upload → unauthenticated attachment download by URL token →
  `/events/collect`; push websocket upgraded to `101 Switching Protocols`.
- After SSO the admin panel renders with its `/vw_static/` assets, and an authenticated
  write (`POST /admin/users/<id>/deauth`) returns 200.
